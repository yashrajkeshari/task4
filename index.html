        <h1>How to begin with learning Chess?</h1>
        <p>When it comes to learning how to play chess, we’re truly living in a golden age. Thanks to the internet, it’s
            the easiest time in history to learn the royal game without paying a dime. With online play, you don’t even
            need to buy a board.
            The amount and quality of free chess resources on the internet is absolutely astounding. There are so many
            choices available that the hardest part is sorting through them. That’s why I wanted to create this short
            guide to some of the best resources for brand new players.</p>
    </div><div class="video"><iframe class="cent" width="400vw" height="200vh" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/obZLXouxTU4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

       <h3>Step 1: Learning the Rules</h3>
       <p>There are a thousand websites that describe the basic rules of chess, but my favorite is <a href="https://lichess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lichess.org</a>  because
            it teaches you the rules using interactive chessboards. Instead of only reading how the pieces move, you
            actually get the chance to move them around.
            You can access the basic lessons here. Once you’ve mastered those, you can start playing chess right away,
            or move onto more advanced lessons here.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="one">
       <h3>Step 2: Playing Chess</h3>
        <p>The best way to learn chess is to start playing as soon as you know the rules. Some new players feel too
            intimidated to start playing chess right away, and instead go straight to more studying. Don’t try this!
            Studying chess without playing is a waste of time, because you won’t actually get better without practicing
            what you read.
            There are a ton of free websites to play chess on. <a href="https://www.chess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chess.com</a>  is the most popular, and it runs on a freemium
            model. It’s completely free to play, but they have optional paid lessons, puzzles, and analysis.
            Lichess.org is the second most popular site. It’s completely, 100% free and open source, but it does accept
            donations.
            You don’t have to choose between the sites. Most players have an account on each. You can also play on both
            sites without even creating an account, but by signing in you’ll be able to track your progress and get
            paired with opponents who match your skill level.</p>

    <div class="two">
        <h3>Step 3: Expanding Your Knowledge</h3>
        <p>After playing for a few days, you’ll likely be ready to learn even more about chess. The amount of free chess
            material on the internet is nearly endless, and you’ll easily be able to continue progressing for at least a
            year without ever having to pay for study materials.
            One of the best way to improve is by doing chess puzzles, also known as tactics. You can find unlimited free
            puzzles on lichess.org, and a few free puzzles each day on <a href="https://www.chess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chess.com</a>. Another popular website for puzzles is
            Chess Tempo, which has paid and free accounts.
            To start learning chess strategy, you can find many free courses on Chessable. There are also great YouTube
            channels covering chess strategy. The most frequently recommended is <cite> GM John Bartholomew’s.</cite> Another
            fantastic channel is Hanging Pawns, which has many in-depth videos on strategy and openings.
            There really are a practically infinite amount of resources to learn chess online, but the ones linked above
            will provide an excellent, solid foundation. They are all tested and true, used by millions of chess players
            around the world. If you work through all of this material, you’ll be well on your way to beating your
            friends at chess.</p>
